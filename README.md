This repository only exists for the purpose of redirecting people to the [Node exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter), which is the standard
Prometheus exporter for machine/system/host/node-related metrics.

Several people have been confused by the repository name `node_exporter`,
thinking it was an exporter for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Consequently,
they assumed that there wasn't a machine metrics exporter yet. This is why
this dummy repo was created, to catch people's glances and redirect them to
the right place.
